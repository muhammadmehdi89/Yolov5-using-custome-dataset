# Yolov5-using-custome-dataset
This repository contains code for training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset. The YOLOv5 model is a popular object detection algorithm designed for real-time applications. By using a custom dataset, you can train the model to detect objects specific to your domain. I have perfomed annotations on given dataset using cv2 library.
